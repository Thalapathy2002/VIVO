TITLE:
AI-Driven Precision Pest Control System

ABSTRACT:
The "AI-Driven Precision Pest Control System" is an intelligent, automated system designed to detect, monitor, and manage pests in agricultural and urban environments using sensor data, real-time image recognition, and AI-based decision-making. This innovation enhances pest control precision, reduces pesticide usage, and aligns with sustainable agricultural practices. It incorporates edge computing, drone-based interventions, and a feedback loop for continuous learning, improving system efficacy over time.

BACKGROUND & RESEARCH GAP:
Conventional pest control techniques rely heavily on scheduled pesticide spraying, leading to excessive chemical use, crop damage, and ecological imbalance. Existing automated systems lack adaptability, real-time decision-making, and effective environmental data utilization. There is a pressing need for a sustainable, intelligent, and efficient pest control mechanism that minimizes resource use while maximizing precision and adaptability. Our system fills this gap with a scalable, data-driven, and AI-powered solution.

NOVELTY / INVENTION OVERVIEW:
The invention introduces a multi-component, AI-powered precision pest management system. It integrates sensor arrays (environmental and image-based), IoT-based communication, AI models for pest detection and classification, and an automated actuator system for pest control (e.g., drones, sprayers). A feedback system constantly retrains the AI model based on updated field data, enabling adaptive responses to changing pest behavior. The system supports grid- and solar-powered operation, making it self-sufficient in remote areas.
